# README

A few notes:
* Provided seed data (`rails db:seed`). You can log in as `aa@milne.com` with password `password`.
* Added Redcarpet to support authoring in Markdown (been wanting to try out that gem for a while and this ssemed like a good time).
* Added Tailwind (and honestly went a little overboard on the styling) even though I know that wasn't part of the assignment
* Not 100% sure the approach I took with session management logic in ApplicationController is the right way to go but I wanted to avoid duplication in the controllers
